The std::placeholders part is related to std::bind, a C++ utility that allows you to create a callable object by binding arguments to a function (or member function). 

It is a way to "pre-configure" a function so that it can be called later with fewer arguments or with specific arguments already set.

### What is `std::placeholders`?
`std::placeholders` is a namespace that provides placeholder objects (such as `_1,` ` _2`, etc.) that are used with `std::bind` to represent arguments that will be passed to the bound function when it is invoked.

Let's break it down with the following code:
```cpp
PIC.registerBeforePassCallback(
  std::bind(&StopAfterInstrument::beforePass, this, _1, _2)
);
```

`std::bind(&StopAfterInstrument::beforePass, this, _1, _2)`
- `this`: This is a pointer to the current instance of the `StopAfterInstrument` class, which is necessary because `beforePass` is a member function (it needs an instance to operate on).
- **`_1`, `_2`**: These are **placeholders** from the `std::placeholders` namespace. 
	- They represent the arguments that will be passed to the `beforePass` function when the callback is invoked.
	- 

By using these placeholders, `std::bind` is able to "bind" the `beforePass` method to the `StopAfterInstrument` instance while still allowing the arguments (`PassID` and `IR`) to be passed later when the callback is executed.

Why is it needed?
Without the placeholders, std::bind would expect all arguments to be provided when you bind the function.
