The std::placeholders part is related to std::bind, a C++ utility that allows you to create a callable object by binding arguments to a function (or member function). 

It is a way to "pre-configure" a function so that it can be called later with fewer arguments or with specific arguments already set.

### What is `std::placeholders`?
`std::placeholders` is a namespace that provides placeholder objects (such as `_1,` ` _2`, etc.) that are used with `std::bind` to represent arguments that will be passed to the bound function when it is invoked.

Let's break it down with the following code:
```cpp
PIC.registerBeforePassCallback(
  std::bind(&StopAfterInstrument::beforePass, this, _1, _2)
);
```
