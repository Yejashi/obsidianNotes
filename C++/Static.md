In C++, the `static` keyword is used in different contexts, and its meaning depends on where it is applied.

### What does `static` mean?
The `static` keyword in C++ can have different meanings depending on its context:
- Static Member Functions
	- When `static` is used in a class, it declares a static member function or static member variable. 
	- A static member function is not tied to any instance of the class and can be called without creating an object of the class. It can only access static members of the class.
- Static Variable
	- When applied to a variable inside a function, `static` ensures that the variable retains its value between function calls. 
	- It has **internal linkage** and is not visible outside the function.
