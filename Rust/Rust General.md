## Variables

In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value wonâ€™t change.

`let apples = 5;` creates an immutable variable `apples` with the value 5.

To make a variable mutable, we add `mut` before the variable name:
```
let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
```
