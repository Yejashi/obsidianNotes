As modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems become larger and more complex, scientific computing requires larger simulations and more complex and data-intensive applications, like workflows. To expedite scientific advancements, these changes necessitate complex performance analysis, efficient data transfer management, and 
The complexity of scientific computing grows with the scaling and diversification
of modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Large simulations and
data-intensive applications produce immense performance data, necessitating efficient
profiling, data transfer management, and optimization of resources to expedite
scientific advancements. To meet these challenges, sophisticated tools for performance
analysis, bottleneck detection, and scalable data management in various scientific
fields are essential. This PhD proposal introduces two complementary contributions
to addressaddressing these challenges.
