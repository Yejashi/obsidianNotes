## General Workflow

### Step 1 — **Runtime instrumentation (Caliper, Thicket, etc.)**
Collect:
- Region-level wall time, GPU time, and PAPI counters
- Metadata (kernel name, function name, source line)
    

These give you _“what ran and how long it took.”_

### Step 2 — **Compiler optimization remarks**

You gather `.yaml` remark files (`clang -fsave-optimization-record`) for each optimization level (`-O0`–`-O3`), perhaps per kernel.

These give you _“what the compiler did to this code.”_

### Step 3 — **Correlate by region**

Use debug line info to map Caliper regions ↔ source lines ↔ remark entries.  
That lets you ask:

> “This region got faster from -O2→-O3; what new remarks appeared or disappeared?”

### Step 4 — **Hypothesis building**

From that correlation you hypothesize:

- “Vectorization remark appeared → likely SIMD speedup.”
    
- “Loop unrolled → maybe higher register pressure.”
    
- “No remark change but runtime changed → backend or hardware effect.”
    

✅ Up to this point, you’re still in human-readable YAML + Caliper JSON/CSV land — easy to automate.

## 🧠 2. When you need to _go deeper_

Once a hypothesis looks interesting (“why did -O3 slow down this region?”), you descend the stack:

|Layer|What you inspect|Purpose|Machine-readable options|
|---|---|---|---|
|**LLVM IR diffs**|Output from `opt -S -print-changed` or `-fpass-plugin=PrintFunction`|See structural change (loop deleted, inlined, etc.)|Use `-print-changed-format=json` (LLVM ≥17) — gives structured JSON diffs|
|**Optimization pass trace**|`-debug-pass-manager` logs|See which passes actually ran and in what order|Parse textual trace or use `opt --print-pipeline-passes`|
|**Machine code / scheduling**|`llvm-mca`, `llvm-objdump -d`, `-fsave-optimization-record -fsave-optimization-record-passes=machine`|Verify instruction mix, register pressure|`llvm-mca` JSON output gives IPC, bottlenecks|
|**Hardware performance counters**|Caliper, HPCToolkit, perf, rocprof|Validate whether hypothesis holds (cache misses, stalls, etc.)|All export CSV/JSON|
|**Debug metadata linkage**|`llvm-dwarfdump`, DWARF line tables|Re-link machine code to source for region correlation|Dwarf4/5 line info in binary, can parse via `pyelftools`|

By connecting these layers via `DebugLoc` or DWARF line info, you can make the “why” traceable.

## ⚙️ 3. Making it machine-readable

LLVM already gives you structured outputs at multiple levels:

|Artifact|Flag / tool|Format|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Optimization remarks**|`-fsave-optimization-record[={yaml|json}]`|YAML/JSON|
|**Pass diffs**|`opt -print-changed-format=json`|JSON|Gives before/after IR for each pass|
|**Machine performance analysis**|`llvm-mca -output=json`|JSON|Static throughput/latency model|
|**Caliper data**|`cali-query --format json`|JSON|Region metrics|
|**Binary-level info**|`llvm-objdump --source --demangle --disassemble`|text (parseable)|Map instructions back to lines|

You can join on:

- **Source line (file, line, col)**
    
- **Function name**
    
- **Region label (Caliper)**
    

That gives you a fully machine-linkable pipeline.

## 🧩 4. What this buys you

You get a _progressive analysis model_:

|Layer|Question answered|
|---|---|
|**Caliper runtime data**|“Which region is slow?”|
|**Remarks**|“What optimizations did LLVM apply here?”|
|**IR diff**|“How did the code structure change?”|
|**Machine code / counters**|“Did that change actually help or hurt?”|

And you only pay the cost of deeper introspection for the regions that look suspicious or interesting.

## ✅ 5. Suggested tooling stack (all scriptable)

|Purpose|Command|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Save remarks|`clang -O3 -fsave-optimization-record -foptimization-record-file=O3.yaml`|YAML|
|IR diff|`opt -O3 -print-changed-format=json < file.bc > /dev/null`|JSON|
|Pass sequence|`opt --print-pipeline-passes`|text|
|Caliper data|`cali-query -e format=json -q "select function,avg(time)"`|JSON|
|Machine analysis|`llvm-mca -output=json file.s`|JSON|
|Merge layers|Python (pandas / JSON)|Unified dataset|

### 🧠 TL;DR

> ✅ **Yes — your proposed workflow is the right foundation.**  
> Use runtime metrics + compiler remarks to form hypotheses.
> 
> 🔍 When something looks odd, dive deeper with:
> 
> - IR change dumps (`-print-changed-format=json`)
>     
> - pass traces
>     
> - disassembly or `llvm-mca`
>     
> - hardware counters.
>     
> 
> 💾 All of those can be collected in structured (JSON/YAML) form, letting you build a reproducible, machine-analyzable correlation between compiler transformations and runtime performance.
