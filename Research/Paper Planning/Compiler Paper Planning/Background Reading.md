> Abstract—Modern high-performance computing systems are diverse, with hardware designs ranging from homogeneous multi-core CPUs to GPU or FPGA accelerated systems. Achieving desirable application performance often requires choosing a programming model best suited to a particular platform. For large codes used daily in production that are under continual development, architecture-specific ports are untenable. Maintainability requires single-source application code that is performance portable across a range of architectures and programming models. In this paper we describe RAJA, a portability layer that enables C++ applications to leverage various programming models, and thus architectures, with a single-source codebase. We describe preliminary results using RAJA in three large production codes at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, observing 17×, 13× and 12× speedup on GPU-only over CPU- only nodes with single-source application code in each case.

RAJA grew out of a need to support large scale production multi-physics applications in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) ASC program on new ATS platforms, such as Sierra, which place significant constraints on programming methodologies:
- Large code bases. Applications contain O(100K) − O(1M ) source lines and many numerical kernels (some times O(10K)).
