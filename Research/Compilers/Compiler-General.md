### Phases of a program
We write programs in high-level language, which is easier for us to understand and remember. These programs are then fed into a series of tools and OS components to get the desired code that can be used by the machine. This is known as Language Processing System.

The high-level language is converted into binary language in various phases.

##### Preprocessor
A preprocessor, generally considered as a part of compiler, is a tool that produces input for compilers. It prepares the source code for the compiler by performing text substitution and other preprocessing tasks.

##### Compiler 
A compiler is a program that converts high-level language to assembly language.

##### Assembler
An assembler translates assembly language programs into machine code.The output of an assembler is called an object file, which contains a combination of machine instructions as well as the data required to place these instructions in memory.

##### Linker
Linker is a computer program that links and merges various object files together in order to make an executable file. All these files might have been compiled by separate assemblers. The major task of a linker is to search and locate referenced module/routines in a program and to determine the memory location where these codes will be loaded, making the program instruction to have absolute references.
