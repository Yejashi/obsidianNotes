### Register Pressure and Performance
The performance of GPU kernels is highly dependent on "occupancy", where there are various wavefronts (warps) running in parallel.
- **Occupancy** is the fraction of the GPU’s maximum hardware execution capacity that is actively utilized by  wavefronts (warps) on a compute unit.
- Basically, the ratio of active wavefronts per SM/CU to the maximum wavefronts the hardware can support simultaneously.

GPUs execute many wavefronts (warps) in parallel on each compute unit and occupancy determines how many of these wavefronts can be resident and ready to run at the same time.

Occupancy is determined by the per-wavefront consumption of hardware resources, such as registers and shared memory (LDS).

Because these resources are allocated on a per-kernel basis, a kernel that uses more registers or LDS per wavefront reduces the number of wavefronts that can be simultaneously resident on a compute unit.

As a result, high per-wave resource usage lowers occupancy by limiting the number of concurrent waves per CU.

Basically, each compute unit has a fixed budget of registers and shared memory. When a kernel launches, each wavefront reserves a portion of these resources. If a kernel requires many registers, fewer wavefronts can fit within the CU’s resource limits, meaning fewer waves can run in parallel. This reduces occupancy and can limit the GPU’s ability to hide memory and instruction latency.
