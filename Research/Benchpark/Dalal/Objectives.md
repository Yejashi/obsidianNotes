Generate data for Dalal's model with at least **1000x1000 data points**.

The initial approach involved varying `n_ranks` and `n_threads_per_proc`. However, this strategy is limited by the constraints of the available hardware, making it unrealistic to generate the required number of points.

Instead, we should focus on varying **problem-specific parameters** tailored to each benchmark.
