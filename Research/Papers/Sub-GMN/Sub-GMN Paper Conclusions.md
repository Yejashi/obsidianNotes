### Future Work

#### Scaling to very large graphs
Sub-GMN works well in their synthetic experiments (graphs of up to ~300 nodes).
BUT → real-world graphs (social networks, large molecules, knowledge graphs) can be millions of nodes.
->  Sub-GMN will need more research to:
- Improve scalability
- Improve accuracy on very large graphs
Possible solutions → smarter batching, hierarchical matching, sampling, etc.
