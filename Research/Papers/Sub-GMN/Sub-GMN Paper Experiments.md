### Datasets
The authors used synthetic datasets (auto-generated graphs) for controlled experiments.
This allows them to control:
- Graph Size
- Noise Level
- Query vs Data graph differences

#### Dataset 1 -> Fixed query graph
- The same query graph `Q` is used across all samples.
- The authors used synthetic datasets (auto-generated graphs) for controlled experiments.
