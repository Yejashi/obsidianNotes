### Define the pass
To write a pass, you need to subclass the appropriate pass class depending on whether you want to perform an analysis or a transformation.

For example, if you want to create a function pass, youâ€™ll subclass `FunctionPass`. Consider the following example:

### Register the Pass
To ensure your pass is available during the LLVM pass pipeline, you need to register it using `RegisterPass`. The registration mechanism allows LLVM to find and run your pass.

### Run the Pass
Once your pass is implemented and registered, you can run it using the opt tool (LLVM's optimization tool). This tool allows you to specify a pass to run on a module.

For example:
```bash
opt -load ./YourPass.so -track-optimizations input.ll -o output.ll
```
