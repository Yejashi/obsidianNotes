LLVM passes are essential components of the LLVM compiler infrastructure, responsible for analyzing and transforming the Intermediate Representation (IR). Passes are modular, reusable units of work that can optimize, analyze, or transform LLVM IR during compilation. 

There are two primary types of passess in LLVM:
1. Analysis Passes: These examine the IR and gather information, but they donâ€™t modify the code.
