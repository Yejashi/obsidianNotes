A basic block is a straight-line sequence of instructions with no branching except at the end. 

A basic block has the following characteristics:
- Linear sequence: 
	- Contains instructions that execute sequentially
- Single Entry, Single Exit: 
	- Execution enters at the first instruction and exits at the last without branching in the middle.
