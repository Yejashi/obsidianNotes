**LLVM IR** â€“ a target-independent intermediate representation (IR) for compiler optimization and code generation.

Compared to Clang's **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, LLVM IR provides a different level of abstraction by encapsulating extra execution details to enable more powerful program analyses and transformations.

### Writing an LLVM Pass with the new PassManager
A Pass in LLVM is the basic unit that is required to perform certain actions against LLVM IR.

LLVM also consists of multiple Passes that are executed in sequential order, called the Pass pipeline. Figure 9.1 shows an example of the Pass pipeline:

In the preceding diagram, multiple Passes are arranged in a straight line. The LLVM IR for the foo function is processed by one Pass after another.
