The Control Flow Graph (CFG) in LLVM represents the flow of control between basic blocks in a function. 

It is a directed graph where:
- Nodes represent basic blocks
- Edges represent possible transfers of control between blocks

### Structure
- Nodes (Basic Blocks): Each basic block is a single node in the CFG.
