### General Objectives
* Who am i?
* Interesting things about me
* Professional Background
* Current Research/Status
* Interests
* Maybe a blog?

### Infrastructure + Setup
Should i build the website from scratch or utilize a template? I'll probably just look for a template, seems less of a hassle...

Template considerations:
- Portfolio esque front page
- Blog page
- Dark mode, always dark mode
- Easy content additions

### Potential Finds
#### [Academic pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)
![[Pasted image 20241130215941.png]]
Details:
- An academic format personal website template.
- Built with Jekyll
Note:
- The aesthetics are meh
- I could go through the effort to make it look nice, but alas i'm too lazy for even that
- Moreover, it seems a bit difficult to expand the pages in the future


#### [developerFolio](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio)
Details:
- "A clean, beautiful and responsive portfolio template for Developers!"
- A beautiful home page, definitely fits my aesthetic needs.
