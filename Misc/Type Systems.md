#### Static vs. Dynamic Typing

**Static Typing**
- Types are checked at **compile-time**.
- Errors are caught before the program runs.
- Example languages: **C, C++, Java, Rust, Haskell**
- Pros: Better performance, early error detection.
- Cons: Can be verbose (unless type inference helps).

```cpp
int x = 5;  // Statically typed: x is an int
```
