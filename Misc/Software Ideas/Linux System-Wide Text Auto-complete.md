### Why?
I am mind blown something like this doesn't exist, maybe it does and i just haven't looked hard enough. 

I recently came across a random video talking about widespread auto complete in Chinese society that let to them having one of the highest typing speeds in the world. This sparked my curiosity on whether a similar tool exits in the personal computer space. I am currently unable to find such a tool.

Given this, i propose the development of a piece of software to handle this task. Currently, i am using NixOS/Arch with GNOME on my desktop systems. Given that, i wonder if it would be possible to build a GNOME extension that would take some corpus or dictionary or words and would give the user the opportunity to autocomplete a word system wide.

Details:
- Gnome extension
- Works system wide
- Works upon a specified dictionary of words
- Fast and non-cumbersome
- Shows a preview

#### Is this possible under the current constraints of GNOME extensions?
TODO
