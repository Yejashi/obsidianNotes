### 1. Determine if the following three graphs are planar. Justify your answer. If it is planar, draw a Fairy embedding of the graph.

A.)

Graph A is not planar as evidenced by Euler's formula.

B.)

Graph B is planar as seen by redrawing the original graph to have no overlapping  
edges using Fary’s theorem.

C.)

Graph C is non planar because there is no way to draw it in a planar manner.


### Find a planar bipartite graph such that every vertex has degree 3.

### What is the (orientable) genus of Q3 (the binary 3-cube)? What about Q4? Explain with illustrations.

![[Pasted image 20250212153742.png]]
Q3 has a genus of 0 which makes it planar on the other hand Q4 has a genus of 1 because it has a subgrah for K33.

### Consider the following graph orders:

**A:** How large must w be for the w × w grid graph to contain K5 as a subgraph?

It's impossible, no matter how large a grid gets it's always planar by definition since its a grid.

B: Determine whether K4 is contained topologically in K3,3,4.

Since K4 is bipartite there is no vertex with degree two that can be removed to allow subdivision removal.
