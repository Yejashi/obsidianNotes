### 1. Determine if the following three graphs are planar. Justify your answer. If it is planar, draw a Fairy embedding of the graph.

Graph A is not planar as evidenced by Euler's formula.

B.)

Graph B is planar as seen by redrawing the original graph to have no overlapping  
edges using Faryâ€™s theorem.
