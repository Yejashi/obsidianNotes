### 1. Determine if the following three graphs are planar. Justify your answer. If it is planar, draw a Fairy embedding of the graph.

A.)

Graph A is not planar as evidenced by Euler's formula.

B.)

Graph B is planar as seen by redrawing the original graph to have no overlapping  
edges using Fary’s theorem.

C.)

Graph C is non planar because there is no way to draw it in a planar manner.


### 2. Find a planar bipartite graph such that every vertex has degree 3.

### 3. What is the (orientable) genus of Q3 (the binary 3-cube)? What about Q4? Explain with illustrations.

![[Pasted image 20250212153742.png]]
Q3 has a genus of 0 which makes it planar on the other hand Q4 has a genus of 1 because it has a subgrah for K33.

### Consider the following graph orders:

**A:** How large must w be for the w × w grid graph to contain K5 as a subgraph?

It's impossible, no matter how large a grid gets it's always planar by definition since its a grid.

B: Determine whether K4 is contained topologically in K3,3,4.

Since K4 is bipartite there is no vertex with degree two that can be removed to allow subdivision removal. As such it's not possible for K4 to be contained topolgically in K334.

C: Determine whether K5 is a minor of the Wagner graph. Is K5 immersed in the
Wagner graph?

K5 isn't a minor of the Wagner graph because no combination of vertex deletions, edge deletions, or contractions results in K5. Similarly, K5 can't  to be immersed in the Wagner graph since no set of edge lifts produced K5.
