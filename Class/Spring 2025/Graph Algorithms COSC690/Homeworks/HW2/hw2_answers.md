#### 1. Let λ(G) denote the edge-connectivity of a graph G. Show that if λ(G) = k ≥ 2, then the deletion of k edges from G results in a graph with at most 2 components. Is there a similar result for vertex-connectivity?

Suppose we had the following graph:

Which has an edge connectivity of 2, as shown:

We can see that with a graph like this, the minimum degree for any node is now 2. As such, regardless of how the graph changes, if the minimum degree is less than 2 then it cannot have an edge connectivity of λ(G) = k ≥ 2.

We will also have a similar result for vertex connectivity.
