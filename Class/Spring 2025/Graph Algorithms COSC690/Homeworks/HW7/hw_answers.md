### Question 1
Graph isomorphism is a structure-preserving bijection. $G$ is isomorphic to $H$ whenever there exists a bijection f : V (G) â†’ V (H) such that vertices u and v are adjacent in G if and only if f (u) and f (v) are adjacent in H.
1. Produce the largest planar graph you can find that is isomorphic to its own geometric dual.

   Planar graphs that have the same number of faces as vertices seem to always produce isomorphic geometric duals.
2. Characterize graphs that are isomorphic to their own line graphs.
   Cycle graps ($C\subn$)
3. Determine if there exists a planar graph that is isomorphic to both its geometric dual and its line graph. Justify your answer.
