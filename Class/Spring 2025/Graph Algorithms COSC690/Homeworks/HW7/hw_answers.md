Graph isomorphism is a structure-preserving bijection. $G$ is isomorphic to $H$ whenever there exists a bijection f : V (G) â†’ V (H) such that vertices u and v are adjacent in G if and only if f (u) and f (v) are adjacent in H.
1. Produce the largest planar graph you can find that is isomorphic to its own geometric dual.
2. Characterize graphs that are isomorphic to their own line graphs.
3.
