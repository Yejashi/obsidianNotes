Breadth-first search (BFS) is a fundamental algorithm in computer science used for traversing or searching tree and graph data structures. Unlike depth-first search (DFS), which explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking, BFS **examines all nodes at the present depth level** before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This level-by-level exploration ensures that the **shortest path** to a node is found in an unweighted graph.

**Key Properties:**
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of BFS is O(|V| + |E|), where |V| represents the number of vertices and |E| denotes the number of edges in the graph. This efficiency arises because each vertex and edge is processed once during the traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** BFS requires O(|V|) space, primarily due to the storage of the queue that holds vertices to be explored and the set of visited vertices. In the worst case, the queue may need to store all vertices at the current depth level.
- **Completeness:** BFS is complete, meaning it will find a solution if one exists, given that the branching factor is finite. This property makes BFS particularly useful in scenarios where finding the shortest path is essential.
- **Optimality:** In unweighted graphs, BFS is optimal as it guarantees finding the shortest path to a target node. However, in weighted graphs, BFS does not account for edge weights, and algorithms like Dijkstra's are more appropriate.
