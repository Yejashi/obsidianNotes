Breadth-first search (BFS) is a fundamental algorithm in computer science used for traversing or searching tree and graph data structures. Unlike depth-first search (DFS), which explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking, BFS **examines all nodes at the present depth level** before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This level-by-level exploration ensures that the **shortest path** to a node is found in an unweighted graph.
