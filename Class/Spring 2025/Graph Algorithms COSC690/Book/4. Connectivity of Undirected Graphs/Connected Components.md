In graph theory, a **connected component** of an undirected graph is a **maximal subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths,** and which is connected to no additional vertices in the rest of the graph. In simpler terms, it's a **subset of the graph where there's a path between any pair of vertices within that subset, and no vertex in the subset is connected to any vertex outside of it**.

**A component of graph G is a maximal connected subgraph of G.**

**Key Points:**
- **Maximality:** A connected component is maximal, meaning that adding any more vertices to it would break its property of being connected.
- **Disjoint Subsets:** The entire graph can be partitioned into disjoint connected components. Each vertex belongs to exactly one connected component.
