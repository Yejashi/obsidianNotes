In graph theory, **edge connectivity** refers to the minimum number of edges that must be removed from a connected graph to disconnect it. 

This concept is crucial for understanding the resilience of networks, as it indicates how many edges can be removed before the network becomes disconnected.

**Formal Definition:**

Given a connected graph G=(V,E), the **edge connectivity** **Î»(G)** is defined as the smallest number of edges whose removal results in a disconnected graph. In other words, it's the size of the smallest edge cut that separates the graph into two or more disconnected components.
