The Seven Bridges of Königsberg is a historically notable problem in mathematics.

The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on both sides of the Pregel River, and included two large islands—Kneiphof and Lomse—which were connected to each other, and to the two mainland portions of the city, by seven bridges.

The problem was to devise a walk through the city that would cross each of those bridges once and only once.
