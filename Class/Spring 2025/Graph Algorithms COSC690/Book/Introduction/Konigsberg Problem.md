The Seven Bridges of Königsberg is a historically notable problem in mathematics.

The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on both sides of the Pregel River, and included two large islands—Kneiphof and Lomse—which were connected to each other, and to the two mainland portions of the city, by seven bridges.

The problem was to devise a walk through the city that would cross each of those bridges **once and only once**.

Leonhard Euler resolved the problem in 1736 by proving that no such walk could exist. His work **laid the foundations for graph theory**, an area of mathematics that studies **networks and their relationships**.

Euler's method for proving this was groundbreaking because it introduced a way to analyze the problem mathematically, using the concept of nodes (representing landmasses) and edges (representing bridges).
