 Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called arcs, links or lines.)

### Graph

In one restricted but very common sense of the term, a graph is an ordered pair G = ( V , E ) comprising: 
- V, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points)
- E, a set edges, which are unordered pairs of vertices.

**Edge**: An edge connects two vertices. In this case, the edge is represented as {x, y}, meaning it connects the vertices x and y.

**Endpoints of the edge**: The vertices x and y are called the "endpoints" because they are the two vertices connected by the edge.

**Join and incident**: The edge "**joins**" the vertices x and y (it connects them). It's also said to be "**incident**" on x and y, meaning the edge involves or touches these vertices.

**Vertex not in an edge**: It's possible for a vertex to exist in a graph without being part of any edge. In other words, a vertex can be isolated, with no connections to other vertices.




### Undirected Graph

An **undirected graph** is a type of graph in which the edges have no direction. In other words, the connections between the vertices (or nodes) are bidirectional.

This means that if there is an edge between two vertices, you can traverse from one vertex to the other in either direction.

**No multiple edges**: In an undirected graph there can't be multiple edges between the same two vertices in the graph. This means that each pair of vertices can only be connected by a single edge, not more than one.
