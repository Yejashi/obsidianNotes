 Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called arcs, links or lines.)

### Graph

In one restricted but very common sense of the term, a graph is an ordered pair G = ( V , E ) comprising: 
- V, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points)
- E, a set edges which are unprdered pairs of verticies
