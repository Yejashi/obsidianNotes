An adjacency list is a way to represent a graph, where each vertex in the graph is associated with a list (or another type of collection) that contains all the vertices that it is directly connected to by an edge. 

This representation is efficient in terms of memory usage, especially for sparse graphs (graphs with relatively few edges compared to the number of vertices).
