### Introduction

[[Konigsberg Problem]]
	For a path to exist that crosses each bridge exactly once, Euler showed that:
		1. **Two nodes can have an odd degree** (these would be the starting and ending points of the path).
		2. **All other nodes must have an even degree**.
[[Graph Theory]]
	Graph
	Directed Graph
	Undirected Graph
[[[Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)]]]
	A **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is a type of directed graph that has two key properties:
		- **Directed**: The edges of the graph have a direction, meaning each edge points from one vertex to another (just like in a directed graph).
		- **Acyclic**: The graph does not contain any cycles, meaning there is no way to start at a vertex and follow a path of directed edges that eventually leads back to the same vertex.
[[Graph (data structure)]]
	Basic operations of a graph.
	Types of data structures to store a graph
[[Adjacency List]]
	An adjacency list is a way to represent a graph, where each vertex in the graph is associated with a list (or another type of collection) that contains all the vertices that it is directly connected to by an edge. 
[[Adjacency  Matrix]]
	An **adjacency matrix** is another way to represent a graph using a 2D array (or matrix). In this representation, the graph's vertices are represented as both the rows and columns of the matrix, and the matrix elements indicate whether there is an edge between a pair of vertices.
[[Incidence Matrix]]
