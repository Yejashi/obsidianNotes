#### Asymptotics
In asymptotics c and x0 show us where the domination happens. It could be such that a domination night happen for a large n but not for a low number like x0.

If we have an upper bound we use big O(n), i we have a lower bound with use big Omega(n)

What you want with big omega is the inverse of O. Infinitely often.

If we have a big O then we have a little O. Big O is an upper bound little O is a strict upper bound.
