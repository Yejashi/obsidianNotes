## Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms
- Makes the choice that looks best at the moment
- Often recursive
- Used for difficult problem

#### Huffman Coding

## Graph Algorithms
- Represented with adjacency matrix or adjacency list
- Link list can cause pointers to point to 
- Incident Matrix
	- Binary matrix
	- Row with each vertex
	- Vertex for every edge
- Sending graph
	- Don’t use an adjacency matrix
	- Use a DIMACS format

Graph Searching
- Breadth-first search = shortest paths
	- Left to right
	- You can have cross-edges
	- Can’t have back-edges
- Depth-first search = “deeper” search
	- Deepest and as fast as you can
	- No cross-edges
	- Can have back-edges
		- Back-edges are cycles
- Topological Sort
	- A directed acyclic graph = no cycles
	- Edges also called arcs
	- All vertices are arranged on x-axis and will go in that direction
	- Hypergraph - higher fidelity graph

#### Minimum Spanning Trees
- If trees are connected then it’s a forest
- Minimum-spanning-tree means that there are edge weights
