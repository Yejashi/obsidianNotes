## Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms
- Makes the choice that looks best at the moment
- Often recursive
- Used for difficult problem

### Huffman Coding

## Graph Algorithms
- Represented with adjacency matrix or adjacency list
- Link list can cause pointers to point to 
- Incident Matrix
	- Binary matrix
	- Row with each vertex
	- Vertex for every edge
- Sending graph
	- Don’t use an adjacency matrix
	- Use a DIMACS format
