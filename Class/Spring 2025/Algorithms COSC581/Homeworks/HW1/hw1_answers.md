**1. Prove that ( f = 𝛰(g) and f = Ω(g) ) ⇔ f = Θ(g). (This can absolutely be a direct proof, allow yourself to use common sense and definitions. Just practice writing formal and concise work)**


**2. Show x < 2^x for x ≥ 1 using induction. **

**3. If r is a real number such that r^2 = 2, then r is an irrational number. (prove via contradiction) **

**4. For the following set of functions, tell me which f/g pairs demonstrate which of the 6 asymptotic behaviors we discussed in class today. SHOW YOUR WORK. **
