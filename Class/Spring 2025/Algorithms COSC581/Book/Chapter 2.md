## 2.1 Insertion Sort
### **Insertion Sort Overview**

Insertion Sort is a simple algorithm for sorting an array by iteratively placing each element into its correct position relative to already sorted elements. The input consists of an array of _n_ numbers, and the output is a reordered array in non-decreasing order. Sorting often involves _keys_ associated with additional _satellite data_, such as student records with attributes like GPA and age.

### **Concept and Analogy**

The algorithm works similarly to sorting playing cards in hand:

1. Start with an empty left hand and pick the first card.
2. Take the next card from the pile and insert it into the correct position among the sorted cards in the left hand.
3. Repeat for all cards, always maintaining a sorted order in the left hand.

### Pseudocode for Insertion Sort

```cpp
INSERTION-SORT(A, n)
1 for i = 2 to n
2   key = A[i]  
3   // Insert A[i] into the sorted subarray A[1:i-1]  
4   j = i - 1  
5   while j > 0 and A[j] > key  
6       A[j + 1] = A[j]  
7       j = j - 1  
8   A[j + 1] = key  

```

Each iteration selects a new element (key) and shifts larger elements to the right until the key is placed in its correct position.

### **Loop Invariants and Correctness Proof**

A **loop invariant** helps prove correctness by ensuring the following properties:

- **Initialization:** Before the first iteration, the subarray `A[1]` is trivially sorted.
- **Maintenance:** Each step inserts a new element into the correct position while keeping the previous elements sorted.
- **Termination:** When the loop ends, `A[1:n]` is fully sorted.

Loop invariants provide a structured way to verify algorithm correctness, similar to mathematical induction, where:

- The **base case** ensures correctness at the start.
- The **inductive step** proves correctness for subsequent iterations.
- The **termination condition** confirms that when the loop exits, the desired result holds.

### **Pseudocode Conventions**

- **Indentation** defines block structures instead of curly braces or keywords like `begin`/`end`.
- **Loop behavior** resembles that in C, C++, Java, and Python. Unlike some languages, the loop variable retains its final value after iteration ends.

### **Summary**

Insertion Sort is an efficient algorithm for small datasets, working by incrementally growing a sorted subarray. Its correctness is verified using loop invariants, and its implementation follows a structured pseudocode convention.

## 2.2 Analyzing algorithms

#### RAM Model of Computation

The RAM (Random Access Machine) model is commonly used in algorithm analysis. It assumes a generic, single-processor environment with the following characteristics:

- **Instructions** execute one after another without concurrency.
- **Data access** (e.g., reading or writing a variable) takes the same amount of time for each access.
- **Instructions and data accesses** take constant time, even for complex operations like array indexing.

While simplifying assumptions are made in the RAM model, it represents a broad class of computers that use basic operations such as:

- **Arithmetic operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
- **Data movement**: loading, storing, and copying data.
- **Control operations**: conditional branches, subroutine calls, and returns.

Real computers may differ from this idealized model, particularly in terms of the complexity of instructions like exponentiation or bit-shifting. Despite this, the RAM model serves as a useful abstraction for analyzing algorithm performance. It does not take memory hierarchies (such as caches or virtual memory) into account, though it still provides a good approximation for performance on actual hardware.

#### Limitations of the RAM Model

- **Exponential growth and memory limitations**: The RAM model assumes fixed word sizes, which means that the word size does not grow arbitrarily with input size. This prevents unrealistic scenarios where operations on huge amounts of data take constant time.
- **Memory hierarchy**: The RAM model ignores the complexities of memory caches and virtual memory. This simplification makes it easier to analyze algorithms but omits certain performance bottlenecks found in real systems.

Despite these limitations, the RAM model is typically a good predictor of performance on most real-world systems.

### Algorithm Analysis

When analyzing an algorithm, it is essential to focus on:

1. **Input size**: The size of the input is a key factor in determining the running time of an algorithm. For sorting, for example, the input size is usually the number of items to be sorted. In some cases, the number of bits required to represent the input may be more relevant.
2. **Time complexity**: This is the number of instructions or data accesses executed during the algorithm's execution.

To analyze an algorithm's running time, we count the number of times each operation is performed and multiply it by the constant cost of each operation.

#### Example: Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple algorithm that can be analyzed by examining the number of times each line of pseudocode is executed.

- **Best-case scenario**: The input array is already sorted. In this case, each iteration of the loop takes constant time because the `while` loop exits immediately. The best-case running time is linear, denoted as T(n)=a⋅n+bT(n) = a \cdot n + bT(n)=a⋅n+b, where aaa and bbb are constants.
    
- **Worst-case scenario**: The input array is in reverse order. In this case, the `while` loop executes for each element, resulting in a quadratic running time, T(n)=O(n2)T(n) = O(n^2)T(n)=O(n2).
    

In general, the running time depends on both the input size and the nature of the input. The running time of algorithms like Insertion Sort is often described in terms of best, worst, or average cases, with the worst-case often used for formal analysis.

### Key Concepts

- **Cost of operations**: Each operation (e.g., arithmetic, data access) is assumed to take constant time. However, the actual time taken can vary depending on the specific operation and hardware.
- **Input size**: The input size is crucial for determining the running time of an algorithm. For sorting, this is often the number of elements to be sorted.
- **Big-O notation**: To simplify comparisons between algorithms, we use Big-O notation, which expresses the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate. For example, Insertion Sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2).

By analyzing the running time of algorithms through the lens of the RAM model, we can make informed decisions about which algorithm is most efficient for a given problem.

## 2.3 Designing algorithms

### Introduction to Algorithm Design

You can choose from a variety of algorithm design techniques. One such method is **Insertion Sort**, which follows an incremental approach. In this method, for each element in the array, you insert it into the proper position in the already sorted subarray. However, this technique is not the most efficient for large datasets, as it has a higher worst-case running time.

In contrast, this section introduces another design technique, known as **divide-and-conquer**. This method will be explored in more detail in Chapter 4, where we will design a sorting algorithm that has a much better worst-case running time than Insertion Sort. One of the key advantages of divide-and-conquer algorithms is that analyzing their running time is often straightforward, a topic that will be covered in the next chapter.

### The Divide-and-Conquer Method

Many efficient algorithms follow the **divide-and-conquer** paradigm, which involves recursively breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems. These subproblems are similar to the original problem but are smaller in size. Once the subproblems are solved, their solutions are combined to form the solution to the original problem. The general steps involved are:

1. **Divide**: Split the problem into smaller subproblems that are instances of the same problem but smaller.
2. **Conquer**: Solve these subproblems recursively.
3. **Combine**: Merge the solutions of the subproblems into a final solution.

If the problem is small enough (the base case), it is solved directly without recursion.

### Example: Merge Sort

The **merge sort** algorithm is a classic example of the divide-and-conquer method. It recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray has just one element, which is inherently sorted. Then, the subarrays are merged back together in a sorted order.

Here’s how merge sort works step by step:

4. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves by computing the midpoint.
5. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.
6. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves back together to form a sorted array.

#### The Merge Operation

The key operation in merge sort is the **merge** step, which merges two sorted subarrays into one. This operation can be understood using the example of merging two piles of cards, where each pile is already sorted. You compare the top card of each pile, remove the smaller card, and place it into the output pile. This continues until one pile is empty, and the remaining cards from the other pile are added to the output pile.

Merging two sorted arrays involves the following steps:

7. Compare the smallest unmerged element in both subarrays.
8. Place the smaller element in the final array.
9. Repeat the process until one of the subarrays is empty.
10. Once a subarray is empty, append the remaining elements of the other subarray.

The time complexity of the merge operation is **O(n)**, where **n** is the total number of elements being merged.

#### MERGE Procedure

The MERGE procedure works by copying the two subarrays into temporary arrays (L and R), then merging them back into the original array. It uses indices to track positions in the original and temporary arrays. The procedure runs in **O(n)** time, as every element is processed exactly once.

### MERGE-SORT Algorithm

The **MERGE-SORT** algorithm recursively divides the array, applies the merge procedure, and combines the results. It follows these steps:

11. If the subarray has only one element, it is already sorted, and the algorithm terminates.
12. Otherwise, it computes the midpoint and recursively sorts both halves.
13. Finally, it merges the two sorted subarrays using the **MERGE** procedure.

The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is **O(n log n)**, where **n** is the number of elements in the array. This is because the array is split in half **log n** times, and each merge operation takes **O(n)** time.

### Example of Merge Sort Execution

Consider an example where we want to sort an array of size 8. The algorithm divides the array into smaller subarrays, recursively sorts them, and merges them back together. The process proceeds as follows:

- The array is divided into subarrays of size 1.
- Pairs of 1-element subarrays are merged into 2-element sorted subarrays.
- These 2-element subarrays are merged into 4-element subarrays.
- Finally, the 4-element subarrays are merged into the fully sorted array.

### Time Complexity Analysis of Merge Sort

The **divide** step takes constant time, while the **conquer** step involves recursively dividing the array, leading to a logarithmic number of levels. The **combine** step, which involves merging, takes linear time at each level. Since the merge operation is performed at every level of recursion, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.

### Conclusion

The divide-and-conquer method, as demonstrated by merge sort, is a powerful approach for designing efficient algorithms. It breaks down problems into smaller, manageable subproblems, solves them recursively, and combines the solutions. Merge sort, in particular, offers a significant improvement over simpler algorithms like insertion sort, especially for larger datasets.
