### Divide-and-Conquer Method

The divide-and-conquer method is a powerful strategy for designing asymptotically efficient algorithms. It involves solving a given problem recursively by breaking it into smaller subproblems. If the problem is small enough (base case), it is solved directly without recursion. Otherwise (recursive case), the following three steps are performed:

1. **Divide**: Split the problem into one or more smaller instances of the same problem.
2. **Conquer**: Solve each subproblem recursively.
3. **Combine**: Merge the solutions of the subproblems to form a solution to the original problem.

This recursive breakdown continues until the base case is reached, at which point the recursion bottoms out.
