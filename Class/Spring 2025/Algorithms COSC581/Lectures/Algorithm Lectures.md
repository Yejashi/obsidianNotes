#### 1. Performance Measures
When analyzing algorithms, we often evaluate performance using several measures:
- **Worst-case performance:** The maximum time (or number of operations) an algorithm takes on any input of size _n_. For example, in Quicksort the worst-case time is Θ(_n_²) when the pivot is chosen very poorly.
- **Average-case performance:** The expected performance when averaged over all inputs (or all random choices). For Quicksort, under assumptions such as distinct keys and all permutations being equally likely, the average number of comparisons is approximately 1.39 _n_ log₂ _n_.
- **Stability:** Whether an algorithm preserves the relative order of equal elements.
- **Other considerations:** In some cases, external factors (like “out-of-core” processing when data exceeds main memory) must also be measured.

#### 2. Average-Case Analysis of Quicksort
**Assumptions and Recurrence**

For Quicksort’s average-case analysis we assume:

- **Distinct keys:** No duplicates.
- **Uniform randomness:** All input permutations are equally likely (or a random pivot is chosen each time).

Let _F(n)_ denote the average number of comparisons to sort _n_ elements. One can show that
![[Pasted image 20250218041747.png]]
By symmetry (since the two recursive calls are “mirrors” of each other), this simplifies to
![[Pasted image 20250218041803.png]]

This recurrence is a first-order homogeneous relation that—after a suitable change of variable and an asymptotic analysis (often converting the sum into an integral)—can be shown to yield

![[Pasted image 20250218041821.png]]
Thus, while the worst-case performance of Quicksort is quadratic, its average-case performance is excellent.



#### 3. Improving Worst-Case Behavior: Median Selection Strategies

A common idea to “cure” Quicksort’s worst-case is to improve the pivot selection. The lecture presented several algorithms to select the median (or, more generally, to find the k‑th smallest element) which can then be used as a pivot. These algorithms include:

##### Algorithm 1: Sequential Selection
- **Method:** Identify the smallest element, then the next smallest, and so on until the median (the n/2‑th smallest element) is found.
- **Note:** This method is inefficient (linear selection done sequentially without additional structure).

##### Algorithm 2: Full Sorting
- **Method:** Sort the entire file (using any comparison-based sort) and then choose the element at the n/2‑th position.
- **Note:** While correct, it uses O(_n_ log _n_) time—more work than necessary if only the median is required.

##### Algorithm 3: Random Sampling
- **Method:** Pseudo‑randomly select a small subset of elements and use their median as a proxy for the true median.
- **Note:** This is fast but may yield a poor pivot if the sample is not representative.

##### Algorithm 4: Median-of-Medians (Deterministic Linear‑Time Selection)
- **Method:**
    1. **Divide:** Partition the array into ⎡n/r⎤ subarrays of size _r_ (with _r_ typically chosen as 5, which empirical and theoretical analyses suggest is a good constant).
    2. **Conquer Locally:** Find the median of each subarray (which takes constant time per subarray since _r_ is fixed).
    3. **Recursion:** Recursively determine the median of these medians; denote it as _m_.
    4. **Partition:** Use _m_ as a pivot to partition the original array.
- **Analysis:** By careful examination, one can show that every element in the “lower” partition is ≤ _m_ and every element in the “upper” partition is ≥ _m_. In fact, one can prove that each partition has at least _n_/4 elements. This leads to a recurrence for the worst-case time:
		![[Pasted image 20250218042134.png]]
A more refined analysis (sometimes showing the recursive term is closer to T(7_n_/10)) proves that _t(n)_ is O(_n_), i.e., linear.

#### DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

Dynamic programming (DP) is an algorithmic paradigm used to solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler, overlapping subproblems. It is especially powerful for multi-stage decision processes, where the final solution is built step by step from solutions to smaller subproblems.

#### 1. DP Amenability: Multi-Stage Decision Process
Many optimization problems can be naturally divided into stages. In a typical multi-stage decision process:

- **Stages:** The problem is divided into N stages.
- **Decision Options:** At each stage, you have d possible decisions.
- **Brute-Force Complexity:** Without DP, you might explore $O(d^N)$ possible decision sequences.
- **Dynamic Programming Advantage:** DP avoids redundant work by storing intermediate results and building the overall solution efficiently.

#### 2. Classic Examples of DP
Dynamic programming has been successfully applied in various fields. Some classic examples include:
- **Job Sequencing:** Scheduling tasks in an order that optimizes overall performance or cost.
- **Tape Utilization:** Optimally storing data on tape where order and grouping affect retrieval efficiency.

#### 3. The Knapsack Problem as a DP Example
One of the hallmark examples in DP is the **Knapsack Problem**:
- **Problem Statement:**  
    Given a set of items—each with an associated value and size—and a knapsack with a fixed capacity, select a subset of items that maximizes the total value without exceeding the capacity.
    
- **Fractional vs. 0/1 Knapsack:**
    - In the _fractional knapsack problem_, items can be divided; a simple greedy algorithm (choosing items based on value-to-weight ratio) finds the optimum.
    - In the _0/1 knapsack problem_, items are indivisible (each item is either taken or left).
        - A naive approach would consider every item’s inclusion (yes/no), leading to $O(2^n)$ possibilities.
        - Here, each item can be viewed as a stage with two decisions (include or exclude), making it a natural multi-stage decision process.

#### 4. Key Challenges in Formulating a DP Solution
When setting up a DP formulation, several practical issues must be addressed:
- **Formulation:** How to define the state, decision, and return variables that capture the essence of the problem.
- **Tracking Partial Solutions:** Efficiently keeping track of solutions to subproblems (often via a DP table).
- **Ensuring Completeness:** Making sure that all possible decision sequences are considered without unnecessary repetition.
- **Avoiding Loops:** Preventing infinite loops or redundant recalculations.
- **Efficiency:** Balancing the trade-off between time and space—DP often uses extra memory (to store subproblem solutions) to save computational time.

**Solution Strategy:**
- Use a DP table (or memoization) for each stage.
- Prune or avoid considering suboptimal partial solutions.
- Store (cache) intermediate results so that each subproblem is solved only once—this is the essence of “trading space for time.”

#### 5. Notation and Variables in DP
At each stage i of a DP formulation, we typically define:
- **$s_i$(State Variable):** Represents the condition or configuration of the system at stage i.
- $d_i$ **(Decision Variable):** The choice made at stage i.
- **$r_i$​ (Return Variable):** The cumulative “reward” or cost from stage i onward.

An asterisk (e.g., $r_i^*$, $d_i^*$) denotes the **optimal** value or decision for that stage.


#### 6. The Backwards Approach and Process Diagram
Dynamic programming often uses a _backwards_ (or “backward induction”) approach:
- **Concept:** Start at the final stage where the outcome is known, and work backwards to determine the optimal decision at each preceding stage.

**Process Diagram (Conceptual):**  
Imagine a flowchart where:
- The final stage provides a known return.
- At each stage i, you compute the optimal return $r_i^*(s_i)$ as: $r_i^*(s_i) = \max_{d_i \in D(s_i)} \left\{ r_i(s_i, d_i) + r_{i+1}^*(s_{i+1}) \right\}$
- The decision  $d_i^*$ that maximizes this expression is the optimal decision at stage i.

![[Pasted image 20250211164659.png]]

#### 7. Bellman's Principle of Optimality
Dynamic programming is built on **Bellman's Principle of Optimality**, which states:

> _An optimal decision sequence has the property that, regardless of the initial state and decision, the remaining decisions must form an optimal sequence for the resulting state._

In other words, if you have an optimal path (or decision sequence) from stage 1 to N, then for any intermediate stage i, the remaining sequence from i to N must also be optimal given the state at stage i.

This principle underpins the recursive structure of the DP formulation.


#### DP Table Format and Example Structure

When implementing a DP solution (for example, for the 0/1 knapsack problem), the DP table is structured as follows:
- **Rows:** Often represent the state (or remaining capacity in knapsack problems).
- **Columns:** Represent the decisions (or items being considered).
- **Entries:** Each cell in the table stores the optimal value (or cost) achievable with a given state and set of decisions.

![[Pasted image 20250211165305.png]]

For the 0/1 knapsack problem:
- The table has one dimension for the items (each item being a stage) and another for the remaining capacity.
- The table is filled using a recurrence relation that compares the value of including an item versus excluding it.

For the 0/1 knapsack problem example, the DP table is organized with five key columns:
- **Row Header:** Identifies the current stage or state.
- **Decision Parameter Headers:** Label the different decision scenarios.
- **0 Decision Column:** Shows the result if you decide _not_ to include the item.
- **1 Decision Column:** Shows the result if you decide to include the item.
- **Best Decision Column:** Indicates the optimal decision (either 0 or 1) for that stage.

**For homework, a table for each stage.**

## Lecture 8

A Good Example – Reliability Design – Well Known within the Operations Research Community.
- The goal is to determine the optimal replication (number of copies) of various device types—arranged in series—with each device having multiple copies in parallel to enhance reliability, all while adhering to a total cost constraint.

#### 1. Problem Formulation
We are given:
- **Device Types:** n different types, each connected in series.
- **Replication:** For each device type i, you can choose $m_i$​ copies arranged in parallel.
- **Costs:** Each copy of device type i has cost $c_i​$.
- **Reliability:** The reliability of a single device of type i is $\Phi_i(1)$.
- **System Reliability:** Since devices are in series, the overall system reliability is the product of the reliabilities at each stage: $\text{System Reliability} = \prod_{i=1}^n \Phi_i(m_i)$
- **Cost Constraint:** The total cost must not exceed C :  $\sum_{i=1}^n c_i m_i \leq C$
- **Decision Variables:** Each $m_i$​ must be a positive integer.

For example, suppose:
- n=10 (types)
- C=10 (total cost)
- $c_i$=1 (cost per device) 
- while $\Phi_i$(1)=0.9 (reliability of a single device) for all i.

Then $m_i$ is 1 for all i, and $\prod_{i=1}^n \Phi_i(m_i)$ = 0.35 (system reliability)

#### 2. Modeling Device Replication

**2.1 Reliability of Replicated Devices**
If a single device of type i has reliability $\Phi_i(1)$, then the probability of failure is $1 - \Phi_i(1)$.

Assuming independent failures, the probability that all $m_i$ copies fail is $(1 - \Phi_i(1))^{m_i}$.

Thus, the reliability when using $m_i$​ copies is: $\Phi_i(m_i) = 1 - \left(1 - \Phi_i(1)\right)^{m_i}$

_Example:_ If Φi(1)=0.9, then for $m_i=2$: 
	$\Phi_i(2) = 1 - (0.1)^2 = 0.99$

**2.2 Upper Bound on Copies**
Each device’s replication is further constrained by the overall cost. In general, for device type i:
	$c_i m_i \leq C - \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^n c_j$

which implies

	$m_i \leq \left\lfloor \frac{C - \sum_{j=1}^{n} c_j + c_i}{c_i} \right\rfloor$

Regardless, we know that we must at the very least take one copy of each device.
- Suppose we have a total budget C of 100.
- Suppose we have $c_1$ = 10 $c_{2}=20$ $c_3=10$ , then at the very least we must spend at least 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 on single copies.
- The remaining budget of 60 can be allocated on copies to maximize reliability. 


#### 3. A Specific Example
> Problem At Hand: If there is some total cost C, and we have n device types, then how many copies of each device should i buy to maximize the total system reliability.

Consider the following system parameters:
- **Number of Device Types:** $n=3$
- **Total Budget:** $C=105$
- **Costs:** $c_{1}= 30, c_{2} = 15, c_{3}= 20$ 
- **Single-Device Reliabilities:**  
    $\Phi_1(1)=0.9,\quad \Phi_2(1)=0.8,\quad \Phi_3(1)=0.5$

**3.1 Feasible Replication Limits**

![[Pasted image 20250217054204.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250217071740.png]]
#### Building the DP Tables

The DP approach proceeds in stages, one for each device type. The overall state is represented by the remaining budget, which ranges from 0 to 105.

rows: state
columns: decisions
##### Stage 1: Device Type 1
![[Pasted image 20250217054717.png]]
- **Decision $d_1$​:** Choose $m_{1}= 1$ or $2$ copies.
- **Cost Incurred:**
    - $m_{1}= 1$ uses 30 units;
    - $m_{1} = 2$ uses 60 units.
- **Reliability:**
    - Φ1(1)=0.9
    - $\Phi_1(2)=0.99$ (since $1-(0.1)^2=0.99$)
- **DP Table:**  
    The table rows represent remaining budget intervals (e.g., [30,59], [60,70]) and columns represent the possible decisions. The table records the reliability values and marks the optimal decision $d_1^*$​.

##### Stage 2: Device Type 2
![[Pasted image 20250217055514.png]]

- **Decision $d_2$:** Choose $m_{2}= 1,2$ or 3 copies.
- **Cost Incurred:**  
    Each copy costs 15; so possible additional costs are 15, 30, or 45.
- **Reliability:**
    - For one copy: $\Phi_2(1)=0.8$.
    - For two copies: $\Phi_2(2)=1 - (0.2)^2 \approx 0.96$ (the notes use values like 0.864, 0.8928, which may result from additional problem-specific details).
- **DP Table:**  
    The DP table for stage 2 is built for different remaining budget ranges (e.g., [45,59], [60,64], etc.), with each cell recording the best reliability achievable and the optimal decision $d_2^*$​.

### Network flow

#### **Network**

- A network is represented as a **weighted directed graph** with **arcs** instead of edges.
- Special nodes:
    - **Source (s)**: Usually has an **in-degree of zero**.
    - **Sink (t)**: Usually has an **out-degree of zero**.

#### **Flow**

- A labeling of arcs in the network that represents flow.
- The assigned flow must **not exceed** the arc’s capacity (i.e., `flow ≤ capacity`).

#### **Maximum Flow Problem**

- Given a network, determine the maximum possible flow from **source (s) to sink (t)** while respecting capacity constraints.

#### **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**

1. Start with an initial flow that satisfies capacity constraints.
2. **Find an augmenting path** (if one exists):
    - Begin at **s**.
    - Use a **greedy labeling and scanning** approach.
    - Continue until reaching **t**.
3. Increase the flow along this path by the **smallest residual capacity** (bottleneck capacity).
4. Repeat until no more augmenting paths exist.

#### **Observations**

- Flow is conserved at all **internal nodes**, following **Kirchhoff’s Current Law**.

📖 **Reference:**

- **Basic Ford-Fulkerson method:** See PDF **page 698**.
- **Algorithm details and examples:** See **page 708**.

## Lecture 10
### **Maximum Bipartite Matching**

1. Begin with a **finite, simple, undirected bipartite graph**.
2. Add two special nodes:
    - **Source (s)**, connected to every vertex in the **left partite set**.
    - **Sink (t)**, connected to every vertex in the **right partite set**.
3. Replace all edges with **directed arcs** from **left to right**.
4. Assign a **weight of 1** to all arcs.

### **Edge Connectivity**

1. Start with a **finite, simple, undirected graph**.
2. Replace each edge with **two directed arcs**, both assigned a **weight of 1**.
3. Choosing **s and t**:
    - Fix **s** arbitrarily.
    - Let each remaining vertex, one at a time, act as **t**.
    - The **minimum of all computed maximum flows** represents the **edge connectivity**.
4. **Why not try every vertex as s?**
    - Once **s** is fixed, iterating over potential **t** values suffices to determine edge connectivity.

### **Boolean Matrix Decidability**

- Given:
    - **m rows** with sums **(r₁, ..., rₘ)**.
    - **n columns** with sums **(c₁, ..., cₙ)**, ensuring **∑rᵢ = ∑cⱼ**.
- Goal:
    - Determine if a **Boolean matrix** exists that satisfies these row and column sums.
- Approach:
    - Construct a **network** from a **complete m × n bipartite graph**.
    - Compute the **maximum flow** to check feasibility.

### **Linear Programming (LP)**

- **Programming** (old term): Originally meant **solving via tabulation**.
- **Mathematical Programming**:
    - **Numerical formulation** (not categorical).
    - **Optimization problem**: Finding the best solution.

#### **General LP Framework**

- **Variables**: x1,x2,…x_1, x_2,
- **Objective Function**: Maximize or minimize a **linear combination** of variables.
- **Constraints**: Restrictions on variables, ensuring feasibility.
- **Key Property**: All relationships must be **linear** (no products or powers).
- **Reference**: See **PDF page 875** for terminology.

#### **Geometric Interpretation (PDF page 878)**

- Constraints define **cutting planes**.
- The **feasible region** forms a **2D simplex** (shaded area).
- The **moving dotted lines** (e.g., x1+x2x_1 + x_2x1​+x2​) indicate possible optima.
- The **optimal solution** always lies at **a corner of the feasible region**.

**Polynomial Multiplication and Fast Fourier Transform**
[FIll out the rest based on his writeup]

Classic CS Example
- Compute i = j + k
- But j and k come as zoned decimal representations
	- g = CVB (convert to binary)
	- h = A(add)
	- g^-1 = CVD (convert to decimal and patch sign)

So what of polynomial multiplication?
- Let A, B denote polynomials in x, each of degree n
- Want C = A * B (a polynomial in x of degree 2n)

Direct vs Indirect Comutations

A and B , can multiply them together will give polynomial C but takes n^2 time

glossing
- regroup alternating terms
- change of variable (n = N/2)
- Turn on polynomial of degree N-1 into two polynomials of degree  N/2-1
- Resultant recurrence is T(N) = 2T(N/2) + O(N)
- So T(N) is O(NlogN)
