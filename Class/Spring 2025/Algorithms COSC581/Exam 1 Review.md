### 1. Asymptotics
L'hopitals Rule
> derivative of a log


### 2. Master Theorem & Solving Recurrances

example of case 3
- f(n) = 2T($n/2$) + $\Theta(n^2)$ 
- b = 2 

### 3. Sorting
- Know the table
- Call sequences for recursive ones
	- Merge sort
	- Heap sort (build the heap)

### 4. Dynamic Programming
Runtime of dynamic programming
- O($d^n$)

Principal of Optimality
- At the optimum solution, you can go to any stage i such that, no matter the value of $s_i$ and $d_i$ , the subsequent decisions $d_i+1$, $d_i+2$, ... $d_n$ are optimal.

### 5. Algorithms
Know how to build recurrences based on pseudocode.
- Merge sort
- Quicksort
