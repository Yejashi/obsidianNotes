#### Betweenness centrality is a measure of centrality based on the number of shortest paths that pass through each vertex. Describe (do not code) an algorithm that uses the results of your all paths shortest path code from question 1 to calculate the betweenness centrality of each vertex in your graph.

I already had the output of the APSP program, which provides the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. To calculate betweenness centrality, I will iterate through all the shortest paths and count how often each vertex appears as an intermediate step between a start and end vertex. For each path, I will track the vertices visited (excluding the start and end) and update a global count dictionary. Once all paths are processed, the final tally for each vertex will represent its betweenness centrality, indicating how often it lies on the shortest route between other vertices.
