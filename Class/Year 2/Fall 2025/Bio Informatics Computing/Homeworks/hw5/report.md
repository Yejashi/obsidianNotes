## Question 2: Hamming Distance Program
I modified my global alignment code to do hamming distance. The executable is `hamming_distance.py`.  

Example use case:
```
python3 hamming_distance.py  small.fasta      
0       1       15      16      14
1       0       14      15      13
15      14      0       1       1
16      15      1       0       2
14      13      1       2       0
```

## Question 3

## Question 4
The only differences I see are that NEIGHBOR lets branch lengths vary, while KITSCH forces everything to line up. So KITSCH ends up with same leaf heights and slightly different branch lengths.
