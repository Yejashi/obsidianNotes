When finding the the other strand of DNA
- Find its complements (A<--->T)
- Then reverse it
	- This is because 5 prime have to be on the left and 3 prime on right

For neiandrethal do p(A) * p(T) ...

2 sequences
- calculate probability of a t c g's.

Markov stuff
- C A T A T
- Count al necluitodes
	- There are CA AT TA AT
- P(T | A) = 1
- P(C | A) = 0
- P(G | A) = 0

Two kinds of homology:
- ORthologous - speciation based split
- Paralagous - gene duplication-basedsplit
