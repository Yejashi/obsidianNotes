#### **Reverse compliment**
- DNA comes in 5'->3' format.
- To get reverse complement:
	- Get matching nucleotide for every nucleotide (A->T C->G)
		- It is currently in 3'->5' format
	- Reverse to turn into 5'->3' format.

Solution:
- 5' CATAT 3'
- 3' GTATA 5'
- 5' ATATG 3'

#### **Alignment**
##### Global Alignment
